# Crime-Against-Women
A data analysis project on a Crime Against Women dataset.

Crime against women, a global human rights issue, has emerged as an impediment to the ideals of equality and freedom. Crime against women is a powerful control of their lives; it affects women of every age, ethnicity, region or religion. Studies have found that women are most at risk from men known to them. Methodologically, this paper is based on data extracted from NCRB reports and supplemented by other published resources such as books, articles and reports of governmental/ non-governmental organizations. This paper attempts to examine various types of crimes committed against women. It also attempts to engage rather theoretically with the notions of and inter-linkages between law, crime and women. Towards the end, the paper offers an analysis of various crimes committed against women in India, in addition to exploring the consequences thereof. This paper will serve as a guide to design mechanisms to counter this menace.
